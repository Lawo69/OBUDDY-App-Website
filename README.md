# OBUDDY - Building Campus Connections

The OBUDDY app aims to address the challenges faced by students in building connections and fostering a sense of community on campus, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the disruption caused by the pandemic, students missed out on the opportunity to interact with their peers in person, leading to a lack of bonding and limited social connections. OBUDDY seeks to bridge this gap by providing a platform that enables students to connect, communicate, and build meaningful relationships within their campus community.
